## Installation

1. To install DVC, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install dvc
    ```
2. Initialize a new DVC project in the current directory:
    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```
3. Add a data file to DVC. This command creates a corresponding DVC file that tracks the data and manages its versioning:
    ```bash
    dvc add <file> # Replace `<file>` with the path to your data file.
    ```
4. Check the status of tracked files:
    ```bash
    dvc status
    ```

5. To restore files to their state at a specific commit or branch, you can use the `dvc checkout` command. This is particularly useful when you want to revert changes made to your data, code, or models back to a previous state.
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch or git log id> # to view specific commit or branch

    dvc checkout # it will show the content in the specific commit or branch
    ```
